.SH NAME
rlm_pap \- FreeRADIUS Module
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIrlm_pap\fP module authenticates RADIUS Access-Request packets
that contain a User-Password attribute.  The module should also be
listed last in the \fIauthorize\fP section, so that it can set the
Auth-Type attribute as appropriate.
.PP
When a RADIUS packet contains a clear-text password in the form of a
User-Password attribute, the \fIrlm_pap\fP module may be used for
authentication.  The module requires a "known good" password, which it
uses to validate the password given in the RADIUS packet.  That "known
good" password should be supplied by another module
(e.g. \fIrlm_files\fP, \fIrlm_ldap\fP, etc.), and is usually taken
from some kind of database.
.PP
This module understands many kinds of password hashing methods, and
requires that the "known good" version of the password be placed into
one of the following attributes:
.PP
.DS
.br
    User-Password           clear-text passwords
.br
    Crypt-Password          Unix-style "crypt"ed passwords
.br
    MD5-Password            MD5 hashed passwords
.br
    SMD5-Password           MD5 hashed passwords, with a salt
.br
    SHA-Password            SHA1 hashed passwords
.br
    SSHA-Password           SHA1 hashed passwords, with a salt
.br
    NT-Password             Windows NT hashed passwords
.br
    LM-Password             Windows Lan Manager (LM) passwords.
.DE

The module tries to be flexible when handling the MD5, SMD5, SHA,
SSHA, NT, and LM passwords.  They are listed in the dictionary as type
"octets", so FreeRADIUS expects them to be represented in the various
configuration files using the follow format:
.PP
.DS
.br
    NT-Password = 0xB7C899154197E8A2A33121D76A240AB5
.DE
.PP
External databases may, however, store these passwords as hex or
base64 encoded strings.  As it is not practical to make the external
databases return the passwords in a format expected by FreeRADIUS,
this module will look for passwords in the above formats, and work
with them to create a password in the format that FreeRADIUS can use.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.PP
This module takes no configuration, as it automatically looks for one
of the above "known good" passwords, and uses it for authentication.
.PP
For backwards compatibility, there are old configuration parameters
which may be used, although we do not recommend them.  Please see
\fIradiusd.conf\fP for details.
