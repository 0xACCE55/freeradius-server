#	This is the master dictionary file, which references the

#	Any new/changed attributes MUST be placed in this file, as

#  These two dictionaries define attributes which conflict with the
#  IANA assigned attributes.  They define attributes for equipment which
#  is 5-10 years old, and which should *no longer* be used.
#
#  Moving the dictionaries here has the following effect:
#
#	1) The "old" names in the dictionaries can still be used in
#	   SQL, the "users" file, etc.
#
#	2) Access-Request and Accounting-Request packets will use the
#	   "new" names.

#  The DHCP dictionary is used only when the server is built with
#  "configure --with-dhcp".  It is not (and should not) be used in
#  other situations.  If you are running just a RADIUS server, this
#  line can be deleted.  If you are using DHCP, the following line
#  should be uncommented.
#
#  Ideally, the "configure" process should automatically enable this
#  dictionary, but we don't yet do that.

#
#	Place additional attributes or $INCLUDEs here.  They will
#	over-ride the definitions in the pre-defined dictionaries.
#
#	See the 'man' page for 'dictionary' for information on
#	the format of the dictionary files.

#
#	If you want to add entries to the dictionary file,
#	which are NOT going to be placed in a RADIUS packet,
#	add them here.  The numbers you pick should be between
#	3000 and 4000.

#ATTRIBUTE	My-Local-String		3000	string
#ATTRIBUTE	My-Local-IPAddr		3001	ipaddr
#ATTRIBUTE	My-Local-Integer	3002	integer
