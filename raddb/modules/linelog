#  The "linelog" module will log one line of text to a file.
#  Both the filename and the line of text are dynamically expanded.
#
#  We STRONGLY suggest that you do not use data from the
#  packet as part of the filename.
#
linelog {
	#
	#  The file where the logs will go.
	#
	#  If the filename is "syslog", then the log messages will
	#  go to syslog.
	filename = ${logdir}/linelog

	#
	#  The default format string.
	format = "This is a log message for %{User-Name}"

	#
	#  This next line can be omitted.  If it is omitted, then
	#  the log message is static, and is always given by "format",
	#  above.
	#
	#  If it is defined, then the string is dynamically expanded,
	#  and the result is used to find another configuration entry
	#  here, with the given name.  That name is then used as the
	#  format string.
	#
	#  If the configuration entry cannot be found, then no log
	#  message is printed.
	#
	#  i.e. You can have many log messages in one "linelog" module.
	#  If this two-step expansion did not exist, you would have
	#  needed to configure one "linelog" module for each log message.

	#
	#  Reference the Packet-Type (Access-Request, etc.)  If it doesn't
	#  exist, reference the "format" entry, above.
	reference = "%{%{Packet-Type}:-format}"

	#
	#  Followed by a series of log messages.
	Access-Request = "Requested access: %{User-Name}"
	Access-Reject = "Rejected access: %{User-Name}"
	Access-Challenge = "Sent challenge: %{User-Name}"

	#
	#  The log messages can be grouped into sections and
        #  sub-sections, too.  The "reference" item needs to have a "."
	#  for every section.  e.g. reference = foo.bar will reference
	#  the "foo" section, "bar" configuration item.
	#
	#  Both "foo" and "bar" can be dynamically expanded, such as
	#  reference = "Accounting-Request.%{Acct-Status-Type}"
	#

	#
	#  Used if:	reference = "foo.bar".
	foo {
	    bar = "Example log.  Please ignore"
	}
