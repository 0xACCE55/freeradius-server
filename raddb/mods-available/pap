# PAP module to authenticate users based on their stored password
#
#  Supports multiple encryption/hash schemes.  See "man rlm_pap"
#  for details.
#
#  For instructions on creating the various types of passwords, see:
#
#  http://www.openldap.org/faq/data/cache/347.html

pap {
	#  By default the server will use heuristics to try and automatically
	#  handle base64 or hex encoded passwords. This behaviour can be
	#  stopped by setting the following to "no".
#	normalise = yes


	# Sites using Microsoft Active Directory may wish to authenticate PAP
	# requests against the directory. With Samba installed and configured,
	# the following options will pass the credentials to winbind for
	# authentication.
	#
	# Using this option requires libwbclient from Samba 4.2.1 or later.
	#
	# Setting winbind_username will disable internal PAP authentication. A
	# second instance of the pap module should be used if both methods are
	# required.
	#
#	winbind_username = "%{User-Name}"
#	winbind_domain = "YOUR_AD_DOMAIN"


	# The following configuration shoudl be used only when
	# winbind_username is set.
	#
	# Information for the winbind connection pool. The configuration
	# items below are the same for all modules which use the new
	# connection pool.
	#
#	pool {
		#  Connections to create during module instantiation.
		#  If the server cannot create specified number of
		#  connections during instantiation it will exit.
		#  Set to 0 to allow the server to start without the
		#  winbind daemon being available.
#		start = ${thread[pool].start_servers}

		#  Minimum number of connections to keep open
#		min = ${thread[pool].min_spare_servers}

		#  Maximum number of connections
		#
		#  If these connections are all in use and a new one
		#  is requested, the request will NOT get a connection.
		#
		#  Setting 'max' to LESS than the number of threads means
		#  that some threads may starve, and you will see errors
		#  like 'No connections available and at max connection limit'
		#
		#  Setting 'max' to MORE than the number of threads means
		#  that there are more connections than necessary.
#		max = ${thread[pool].max_servers}

		#  Spare connections to be left idle
		#
		#  NOTE: Idle connections WILL be closed if "idle_timeout"
		#  is set.  This should be less than or equal to "max" above.
#		spare = ${thread[pool].max_spare_servers}

		#  Number of uses before the connection is closed
		#
		#  0 means "infinite"
#		uses = 0

		#  The number of seconds to wait after the server tries
		#  to open a connection, and fails.  During this time,
		#  no new connections will be opened.
#		retry_delay = 30

		#  The lifetime (in seconds) of the connection
		#
		#  NOTE: A setting of 0 means infinite (no limit).
#		lifetime = 86400

		#  The pool is checked for free connections every
		#  "cleanup_interval".  If there are free connections,
		#  then one of them is closed.
#		cleanup_interval = 300

		#  The idle timeout (in seconds).  A connection which is
		#  unused for this length of time will be closed.
		#
		#  NOTE: A setting of 0 means infinite (no timeout).
#		idle_timeout = 600

		#  NOTE: All configuration settings are enforced.  If a
		#  connection is closed because of "idle_timeout",
		#  "uses", or "lifetime", then the total number of
		#  connections MAY fall below "min".  When that
		#  happens, it will open a new connection.  It will
		#  also log a WARNING message.
		#
		#  The solution is to either lower the "min" connections,
		#  or increase lifetime/idle_timeout.
