#  An example which defines a second instance of the "files" module.
#  This instance is named "second_files".  In order for it to be used
#  in a virtual server, it needs to be listed as "second_files"
#  inside of the "authorize" section (or other section).  If you just
#  list "files", that will refer to the configuration defined above.
#

#  The two names here mean:
#	"files" - this is a configuration for the "rlm_files" module
#	"second_files" - this is a named configuration, which isn't
#			the default configuration.
files second_files {
	#key = "%{Stripped-User-Name:-%{User-Name}}"

	#  The names here don't matter.  They just need to be different
	#  from the names for the "files" configuration above.  If they
	#  are the same, then this configuration will end up being the
	#  same as the one above.
	usersfile = ${confdir}/second_users
	acctusersfile = ${confdir}/second_acct_users
	preproxy_usersfile = ${confdir}/second_preproxy_users
}
