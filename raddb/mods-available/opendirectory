#  = Opendirectory Module
#
#  The `opendirectory` module is only used when the server is running on the same
#  system as OpenDirectory.  The configuration of the module is hard-coded
#  by Apple, and cannot be changed here.
#
#  The `MS-CHAP` module will automatically talk to OpenDirectory, if the
#  server is built on an OSX machine.  However, you must also set
#  `dsAttrTypeNative:apple-enabled-auth-mech` attribute in the
#  `/config/dirserv` OpenDirectory record.
#
#  NOTE: You will probably also need to change the user passwords in order
#  to re-generate the appropriate hashes.
#
#  See also https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6053980?tstart=0
#

#
#  ## Default instance
#
#  This module takes no configuration.
