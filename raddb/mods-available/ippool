#  = IPPool Module
#
#  The `ippool` module does server side ip pool management. Should be
#  added in `post-auth` and `accounting` sections.
#
#  The module also requires the existence of the `Pool-Name` attribute.
#  That way the administrator can add the `Pool-Name` attribute in the
#  user profiles and use different pools for different users.
#  The `Pool-Name` attribute is a *check* item not a reply item.
#
#  NOTE: The `Pool-Name` should be set to the ippool module instance
#  name or to `DEFAULT` to match any module.
#

#
#  ## Sample
#
#  <1> The FreeRADIUS service expects some statement into the `radiusd.conf` as below.
#
#  [source, unlang]
#  ----
#  ippool students { [...] }
#
#  ippool teachers { [...] }
#  ----
#
#  <2> Then the `raddb/users` should have.
#
#  [source, rlm_users]
#  ----
#  DEFAULT Group == students, Pool-Name := "students"
#  DEFAULT Group == teachers, Pool-Name := "teachers"
#  DEFAULT Group == other, Pool-Name := "DEFAULT"
#  ----
#
#  NOTE: If you change the range parameters you must then erase the db files.
#

#
#  ## Default instance
#
ippool main_pool {
	#
	#  filename:: The main db file used to allocate addresses.
	#
	filename = ${db_dir}/db.ippool

	#
	#  range_start:: The start ip addresses for this pool.
	#
	range_start = 192.0.2.1

	#
	#  range_start:: The end ip addresses for this pool.
	#
	range_stop = 192.0.2.254

	#
	#  netmask:: The network mask used for this pool.
	#
	netmask = 255.255.255.0

	#
	#  cache_size:: The `gdbm` cache size for the db files.
	#  Should be equal to the number of ip's available in the ip pool.
	#
	cache_size = 800

	#
	#  ip_index:: Helper db index file used in multilink.
	#
	ip_index = ${db_dir}/db.ipindex

	#
	#  override:: If set, the `Framed-IP-Address` already in the reply (if any)
	#  will be discarded, and replaced with a `Framed-IP-Address` assigned here.
	#
	override = no

	#
	#  maximum_timeout:: Specifies the maximum time in seconds that an entry
	#  may be active.  If set to zero, means _no timeout_.
	#  The default value is 0
	#
	maximum_timeout = 0

	#
	#  key:: The `key` to use for the session database (which holds the allocated ip's)
	#  normally it should just be the nas ip/port (which is the default).
	#
	#  NOTE: If your NAS sends the same value of `NAS-Port` all requests, the key should be
	#  based on some other attribute that is in *ALL* requests, *AND* is unique to each
	#  machine needing an IP address.
	#
#	key = "%{NAS-IP-Address} %{NAS-Port}"
}
