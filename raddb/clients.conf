#
#  Definition of a RADIUS client (usually a NAS).
#
#  The information given here over rides anything given in the
#  'clients' file, or in the 'naslist' file.  The configuration here
#  contains all of the information from those two files, and allows
#  for more configuration items.
#
#  The "shortname" is be used for logging.  The "nastype", "login" and
#  "password" fields are mainly used for checkrad and are optional.
#

#
#  Defines a RADIUS client.  The format is 'client [hostname|ip-address]'
#
#  '127.0.0.1' is another name for 'localhost'.  It is enabled by default,
#  to allow testing of the server after an initial installation.  If you
#  are not going to be permitting RADIUS queries from localhost, we suggest
#  that you delete, or comment out, this entry.
#
#
#  Rules for Prefixes
#  ------------------
#  IPv6 prefixes MUST end with :: or IPv6 Address or hostname
#  IPv4 Prefixes MUST end with .0 or IPv4 Address or hostname
#  A hostname is a valid DNS lookup name
#
#  Valid Prefixes
#  --------------
#  For IPv4:
#    192.168.1.1/24
#    10.0/8 = 10.0.0.0/16 = 10.0.0.1/8    != 10/8 
#    192.168.1.1/32 = 192.168.1.1/0
#    hostname/32   = hostname/0  = hostname
#   (32 or 0 or NULL prefix lengths are treated same)
#
#  For IPv6:
#    fec0::/64
#    fec0::1/100
#    fec0::1/128  = fec0::1/0 = fec0::1 
#    hostname/128 = hostname/0 = hostname
#   (128 or 0 or NULL prefix lengths are treated same)
#
#  Invalid prefixes
#  ----------------
#  For IPv4:
#  1) 192.168/16 
#       (MUST end with .0)
#       (replace with 192.168.0/16 or 192.168.0.0/16 or 192.168.1.1/16)
#  2) 192.168
#       (No Prefix, so it is considered as hostname 
#         and also returns 192.0.0.168 instead of 192.168.0.0)
#
#  For IPv6:
#  1) fec0/16
#       (MUST end with ::)
#       (replace with fec0::/16 or fec0::1/16)
#  2) fec0::
#       (No prefix, so it is considered as hostname)

	#  default, otherwise it's not a secret any more!
	#
	#  The secret can be any string, up to 8k characters in length.
	#
	#  Control codes can be entered vi octal encoding,
