#  = ARP Virtual Server
#
#  This is a virtual server that handles ARP.
#
#  It allows the administrator to log ARP packets on the
#  local network.  The idea is that the ARP packets can be
#  checked against a database (e.g. DHCP), or stored in
#  an ARP-specific database.  If something funny is
#  going on, it can produce syslog messages informing the
#  administrator.
#
#  See `arpwatch` for examples of what it should do.   For now,
#  this is just a toy example.
#
#  NOTE: It NEVER sends an ARP packet.
#

#
#  ## Example configuration
#

#
#  ## server arp { ... }
#
#  This is the default `arp` virtual server.
#
server arp {
	#
	#  namespace::
	#
	#  In v4, all "server" sections MUST start with a "namespace"
	#  parameter.  This tells the server which protocol is being used.
	#
	#  All of the "listen" sections in this virtual server will
	#  only accept packets for that protocol.
	#
	namespace = arp

	#
	#  ### The listen section
	#
	#  The `listen` sections in v4 are very different from the
	#  `listen sections in v3.  The changes were necessary in
	#  order to make FreeRADIUS more flexible, and to make the
	#  configuration simpler and more consistent.
	#
	listen {
		#
		#  interface:: The only configuration possible for ARP
		#  is the name of the interface.
		#
		interface = en0
	}

#
#  ### Process an ARP request
#
recv Request {
	ok
}

#
#  ### Process an ARP reply before sending it
#
send Reply {
	ok
}
}
