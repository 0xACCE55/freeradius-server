#  pidfile: Where to place the PID of the RADIUS server.

#
#  Requests which take more time to process than this are killed, and
#  a REJECT message is returned.
#
max_request_time	= 30

#
#  cleanup_delay: The time to wait (in seconds) before cleaning up
#  a reply which was already sent to the NAS.  If it is set too low,
#  then duplicate requests from the NAS MAY NOT be detected,
#  and will instead be handled as seperate requests.
#
cleanup_delay		= 5

#
#  max_requests: The maximum number of requests which the server keeps
#  track of.  This should be 256 multiplied by the number of clients.
#  e.g. With 4 clients, this number should be 1024.
#
#  If this number is too low, then when the server becomes busy,
#  it will not respond to any new requests, until the 'cleanup_delay'
#  time has passed, and it has removed the old requests.
#
#  If this number is set too high, then the server will use a bit more
#  memory for no real benefit.
#
#  If you aren't sure what it should be set to, it's better to set it
#  too high than too low.  Setting it to 1000 per client is probably
#  the highest it should be.
#
max_requests		= 1024

#
#  bind_address:  Make the server listen on a particular IP address, and
#  send replies out from that address.  This directive is most useful
#  for machines with multiple IP addresses on one interface.
#
#  It can either contain "*", or an IP address, or a fully qualified
#  Internet domain name.  The default is "*"
#
bind_address            = *

#
#  port: Allows you to bind FreeRADIUS to a specific port.
#
#  The default port that most NAS boxes use is 1645, which is historical.
#  RFC 2138 defines 1812 to be the new port.  Many new servers and
#  NAS boxes use 1812, which can create interoperability problems.
#
#  The port is defined here to be 1645, for backwards compatibility.
#  It is commented out so that the server will pick up the machine's
#  local configuration for the radius port, as defined in /etc/services.
#
#  If you want to use the default RADIUS port as defined on your server,
#  (usually through 'grep radius /etc/services') set this to 0 (zero).
#
#  A port given on the command-line via '-p' over-rides this one.

#port = 1645

#  if you're debugging a problem with the server.

#  Log passwords with the authentication requests.
#
# allowed values: {no, yes}
#
log_auth_pass	= no

#
#  proxy_requests: Turns proxying of RADIUS requests on or off.
#
#  The server has proxying turned on by default.  If your system is NOT
#  set up to proxy requests to another server, then you can turn proxying
#  off here.  This will save a small amount of resources on the server.
#
#  If you have proxying turned off, and your configuration files say
#  to proxy a request, then an error message will be logged.

# allowed values: {no, yes}

#  Proxy server configuration
#
#  This entry controls the servers behaviour towards ALL other servers
#  to which it sends proxy requests.
#
proxy server {

#
#  If the NAS re-sends the request to us, we can immediately re-send
#  the proxy request to the end server.  To do so, use 'yes' here.
#
#  If this is set to 'no', then we send the retries on our own schedule,
#  and ignore any duplicate NAS requests.
#
#  If you want to have the server send proxy retries ONLY when the NAS
#  sends it's retries to the server, then set this to 'yes', and
#  set the other proxy configuration parameters to 0 (zero).
#
	synchronous = yes

#
#  The time (in seconds) to wait for a response from the proxy, before
#  re-sending the proxied request.
#
#  If this time is set too high, then the NAS may re-send the request,
#  or it may give up entirely, and reject the user.
#
#  If it is set too low, then the RADIUS server which receives the proxy
#  request will get kicked unnecessarily.
#
	retry_delay = 5

#
#  Thread pool configuration.
#
#  The thread pool is a long-lived group of threads which
#  take turns (round-robin) handling any incoming requests.
#
#
#  You probably also want to have a few spare threads around,
#  so that high-load situations can be handled immediately.  If you
#  don't have any spare threads, then the request handling will
#  be delayed while a new thread is created, and added to the pool.
#
#  You probably don't want too many spare threads around,
#  otherwise they'll be sitting there taking up resources, and
#  not doing anything productive.
#
#  The numbers given below should be adequate for most situations.
#
#
thread pool {
#
#  Number of servers to start initially --- should be a reasonable ballpark
#  figure.
#
	start_servers     = 5

#
#  Limit on the total number of servers running.
#
#  If this limit is ever reached, clients will be LOCKED OUT, so it
#  should NOT BE SET TOO LOW.  It is intended mainly as a brake to
#  keep a runaway server from taking the system with it as it spirals
#  down...
#
	max_servers	  = 32

#
#  Server-pool size regulation.  Rather than making you guess how many
#  servers you need, FreeRADIUS dynamically adapts to the load it
#  sees --- that is, it tries to maintain enough servers to
#  handle the current load, plus a few spare servers to handle transient
#  load spikes.
#
#  It does this by periodically checking how many servers are waiting
#  for a request.  If there are fewer than min_spare_servers, it creates
#  a new spare.  If there are more than max_spare_servers, some of the
#  spares die off.  The default values are probably OK for most sites.
#
	min_spare_servers = 3
	max_spare_servers = 10

#
#  There may be memory leaks or resource allocation problems with
#  the server.  If so, set this value to 300 or so, so that the
#  resources will be cleaned up periodically.
#
#  This should only be necessary if there are serious bugs in the
#  server which have not yet been fixed.
#
#  '0' is a special value meaning 'infinity', or 'the servers never exit'
#
