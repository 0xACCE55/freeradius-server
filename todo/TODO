URGENT:

o UPDATE accounting requests aren't handled as in 1.5.4.3 for wtmp
  Is this a problem ? Need to fix in rlm_unix.c
o Fix potentially long locks on radutmp file by radcheck thread
o modular radutmp and radwtmp, as per Alan Curry's old patches.
o configure fixes for builds on Solaris and HPUX.

MEDIUM PRIORITY
o add more support for new configuration files
o enable server to run with child processes
  (This is a little more difficult than the threading changes)
o switch all timers from time() to gettimeofday() so processing is
  less bursty
o replace the module_t method table with a set of register_* functions
  (so different instances of the same module can offer different
  methods)
o get rlm_unix and rlm_sql to work with multiple instances
o have a config file (or section in radiusd.conf) that tells rlm_sql
  what the names of the tables and columns are instead of hardcoding
  them


LOW PRIORITY:
o Write better documentation
o Manual pages for the daemon, utilities and conffiles (some done)
o Fix all FIXME's in the source.
o Fix DBM support:
  - Multiple defaults (done)
  - Fallthrough (hard for not DEFAULT entries)
o there should be a way that radius itself could
  rotate the wtmp file properly. It should write "logout" records for
  all users, move the file to wtmp.0, and create a new wtmp file with
  "login" records for all currently online users.
o split rlm_files into rlm_users, rlm_fastusers (in-memory hash),
  rlm_detail, rlm_dbm... they all should share as much code as
  possible though, not be big cut-and-paste jobs
o New module: rlm_attrmap. assigns a single attribute based on a
  username, with ed-friendly/awk-friendly config file. Because the
  users file is too complicated.
o New module: rlm_fastradwtmp. with a radutmp-style active session
  database to guarantee wtmp records are always written in matching
  pairs. Because radlast is slow.
o New module: rlm_nsupdate (dyndns). Because dynamic addresses are
  cruel.
o New module: rlm_perl.

DONE:
o enable server to run in threaded mode
o rlm_realm module for COMPLETE control of proxying on any attribute
o re-transmits of proxied packets
o operator support in pairmove.
o stripping Prefix/Suffix in accounting
o new configuration file /etc/raddb/radius.conf
o Radius proxy support.
o Max-Simultaneous-Use parameter to avoid double logins.
o Specify a program to be run on succesful login
o Prefix/Suffix support
o Change radutmp format to v2 (see radutmp.h)
o move radutmp to /var/log ?
o Compatibility with radius-2.0
o Support for pidfile
o Configurable logging: both radutmp/radwtmp and details files
o session_id is not numeric but an 8-byte (?) string !
o Detect reboot packet sent by portmaster and clear radutmp / wtmp
o Seperate /etc/raddb/clients into public and private file (secret == secret!)
  Add ts-type field to clients file for checklogin.pl
  Better: return clients to old form (no shortname) and add a new file,
  "nas" or so. Matching on this file is done based on Nas-Ip-Address
  instead of the IP address of the sender. Better if there's a proxy
  in between.
o Allow spaces in usernames (using " or \ to escape)
o Return Proxy-State A/V pairs, in the right order.
o retransmits from the terminal server get proxied with
  a new ID and random_vector. We should check for this!
o Limit logins based on time/date 
  (for example, Login-Hour = 8-18, Login-Day = 0-5 for business hours)
o take out host-order IP addresses
o Support Connect-Rate
