INTEGRATE FROM ALAN:

o operator support in pairmove. Actually should make 2 pairmove's,
  one for the authorize stuff in src/valuepair.c, and another generic
  one in lib/valuepair.c that does what the name implies.

URGENT:

o Prefix/Suffix in users file isn't stripped anymore at the
  accounting stage.
o UPDATE accounting requests aren't handled as in 1.5.4.3 for wtmp
  Is this a problem ? Need to fix in rlm_unix.c

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
o Provide a way to define the locations of all files (/etc/raddb/radiusd.conf?)
  - this will be the newstyle radius configuration file

LOW PRIORITY:
o Write better documentation
o Manual pages for the daemon, utilities and conffiles (some done)
o Fix all FIXME's in the source.
o Fix DBM support:
  - Multiple defaults (done)
  - Fallthrough (hard for not DEFAULT entries)
o there should be a way that radius itself could
  rotate the wtmp file properly. It should write "logout" records for
  all users, move the file to wtmp.0, and create a new wtmp file with
  "login" records for all currently online users.

DONE:
o Radius proxy support.
o Max-Simultaneous-Use parameter to avoid double logins.
o Specify a program to be run on succesful login
o Prefix/Suffix support
o Change radutmp format to v2 (see radutmp.h)
o move radutmp to /var/log ?
o Compatibility with radius-2.0
o Support for pidfile
o Configurable logging: both radutmp/radwtmp and details files
o session_id is not numeric but an 8-byte (?) string !
o Detect reboot packet sent by portmaster and clear radutmp / wtmp
o Seperate /etc/raddb/clients into public and private file (secret == secret!)
  Add ts-type field to clients file for checklogin.pl
  Better: return clients to old form (no shortname) and add a new file,
  "nas" or so. Matching on this file is done based on Nas-Ip-Address
  instead of the IP address of the sender. Better if there's a proxy
  in between.
o Allow spaces in usernames (using " or \ to escape)
o Return Proxy-State A/V pairs, in the right order.
o retransmits from the terminal server get proxied with
  a new ID and random_vector. We should check for this!
o Limit logins based on time/date 
  (for example, Login-Hour = 8-18, Login-Day = 0-5 for business hours)
o take out host-order IP addresses
o Support Connect-Rate
