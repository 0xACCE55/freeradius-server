# Code of Conduct
## 1. Overview

The goal of the FreeRADIUS project is to produce reliable, feature full software which benefits the
open source community.

The GitHub issue tracker and mailing lists have a strict code of conduct.

> Only technical discussion related to FreeRADIUS, the protocols it implements, and its dependencies
> are permitted in GitHub communications and on the mailing list.
> 
> Please note that any off-topic discussion will result in a warning. Continued off topic discussion
> will result in the individual being unsubscribed from the mailing lists and/or permanent
> banishment from the GitHub repositories.

This code of conduct is simple to abide by, and simple to enforce. Unlike other codes of conduct it
does not require participants to be explicitly "inclusive" or "accepting" of certain topics. It
requires participants to be blind to non-technical topics, as those subjects are explicitly off
topic. The FreeRADIUS community is inclusive by virtue of not being exclusive.

## 2. Expected Behaviour

The following behaviours are expected and requested of all community members:

- Ensure that the rules of the community resource you're using have been reviewed in full, [mailing
  list guidelines](http://freeradius.org/list/) for the mailing lists, [the guidelines for
  contributing](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/blob/v4.0.x/.github/contributing.md)
  for GitHub.
- Use a neutral tone with a focus on technical arguments and technical discussion.
- Evaluate contributions, ideas and feedback on technical merit only.  The personal attributes of
  community members are entirely irrelevant and comments of this nature will not be tolerated.
- Research topics using appropriate standards, design documents, and technical manuals before raising
  GitHub issues, or sending pull requests.
  _The FreeRADIUS project has three core team members, around seventy modules, and a very large list 
  of dependencies. We cannot be experts on every part of the
  FreeRADIUS ecosystem and rely on well researched and technically sound contributions to make the
  project a success._

## 3. Unacceptable Behaviour

The following behaviours are unacceptable within our community:

- Non-technical discussion.
- Ad hominem attacks and other personal attacks.
- Willful ignorance.

## 4. Consequences of Unacceptable Behaviour

Where unacceptable behaviour is noted and the community participant informed of behaviour and next
steps, the community participant is expected to comply immediately.

The community organizers will take any action they deem appropriate, which may include permanent
expulsion from the community using appropriate mechanisms.

## 5. Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behaviour or have any other concerns, please notify a
community organizer as soon as possible. social@freeradius.org.

## 6. Scope

We expect all community members, including those who contribute to the project financially or are in
positions of power within the community, to abide by this Code of Conduct in all venues and over all
communication mediums.
