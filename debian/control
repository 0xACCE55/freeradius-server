Description: A high-performance and highly configurable RADIUS server
 A high-performance RADIUS server derived from Cistron's server, and
 generally similar to Livingston's 2.0 server, with support for...
  - many vendor-specific attributes
  - proxying and replicating requests by any criteria
  - authentication on system passwd, SQL, LDAP, users, kerberos, or PAM
  - multiple DEFAULT configurations
  - regexp matching in string attributes
 and lots more.
