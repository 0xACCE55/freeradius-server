Description: A high-performance and highly configurable RADIUS server
 A high-performance and highly configurable RADIUS server.  freeradius is 
 similar to Livingston's 2.0 and derived from Cistron's server, but has 
 support for...
  - many vendor-specific attributes
  - proxying and replicating requests by any criteria
  - authentication on system passwd, MySQL, LDAP, users, PAM
  - multiple DEFAULT configurations
  - regexp matching in string attributes
 and lots more.
