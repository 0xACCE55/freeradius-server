TODO list for the Debian package:

22 Nov 2000 -- Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña 
Since libltdl is an independent Debian package this one should compile against
current Debian version and should *not* install it by himself.

26 Nov 2000 -- Chad Miller
Begin writing manpages for topics listed in the debian/freeradius.undocumented
file.
