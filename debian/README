During conversion from radiusd-freeradius* packages to freeradius* packages,
the directory for configuration has moved to /etc/freeradius from
/etc/raddb. Since a number of things have changed in the way freeradius
is configured this package does not automatically copy your old
configuration; please do that manually.
