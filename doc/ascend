  FreeRADIUS uses Vendor-Specific attributes to send the Ascend attributes.
By default, Ascend NASes send the Ascend specific attributes as NON VSA's,
which conflict with new RADIUS attributes assigned by the IETF.

  If you see a large number of messages about invalid Message-Authenticator
attribute, you most likely have this problem.  There is a configuration
item in the Ascend NAS, which will enable them to work properly.

  It is under Ethernet->Mod Config->Auth.  At the bottom of the menu,
change Auth-Compat from "OLD" to "VSA".
