On linux, you may have to change:

deplibs_test_method="pass_all"

in ../libtool

Otherwise, it complains if the krb5 libs aren't shared.


The file 'src/modules/rlm_krb5/heimdal-krb5.patch' contains an
untested patch to make the module work with heimdal kerberos code.  It
was submitted in the form of a complete 'tar' file, with the image of
a new rlm_krb5 module.  All references to the existing MIT code was
deleted, and the originators of the change were unwilling or unable to
supply a configurable patch.

As such, if you want to use the heimdal code, you must patch the module
yourself, and possibly update the Makefile.

Any patch to make this functionality configurable at build time is
greatly welcomed.
