	Digest module configuration

0. INTRODUCTION

  The digest module performs HTTP digest authentication, as per
  the IETF draft rfc/draft-sterman-aaa-sip-00.txt.  It has been
  successfully tested against a Cisco SIP server.

  However, the draft has been expired by the IETF, so it's unlikely to
  become an "official" standard.

1. USAGE

  To use this module, copy the digest configuration section from
  raddb/experimental.conf, to the 'modules' section of
  raddb/radiusd.conf.

  For example:
	modules {
		...
		digest {
		}
		...
	}

  Then add the word 'digest' to both the 'authorize' and
  'authenticate' configuration sections.  It should probably be listed
  near the top of both sections, as it does not require information
  from other modules.

2. TESTING

  Add the following lines to the top of your 'raddb/users' file:

#---
test	Auth-Type := Digest, User-Password = "test"
	Reply-Message = "Hello, test with digest"
#---


  Once the server has been re-started (debugging mode is recommended),
  use 'radclient' to send the following packet to the server:

  $  radclient -f digest localhost auth testing123

  Where 'digest' is a file containing:

User-Name = "test", Digest-Response = "631d6d73147add2f9e437f59bbc3aeb7", Digest-Realm = "testrealm", Digest-Nonce = "1234abcd", Digest-Method = "INVITE", Digest-URI = "sip:5555551212@example.com", Digest-Algorithm = "MD5", Digest-User-Name = "test"

  You should see authentication succeed.
