RADIUS MS-CHAP v1/v2 + MPPE support module

0. Introduction

rlm_mschap allows to authenticate users via MS-CHAPv1 or MS-CHAPv2
protocol. To authenticate user user via MS-CHAPv1 either NT-Password
or LM-Password is required (this depends on NAS and client settings).
Unless client is some outdated system (like Windows for Workgroups)
NT-Password is usually enougth.
Only NT-Password may be used to authenticate user via MS-CHAPv2. NT
and LM passwords are one way hashes taken with different algorythms
used in Windows network instead of cleartext password.
Cleartext password can't be recovered from hash by some universal method,
but, in fact, unlike unix hashes, one who knows hash can use all network
resources without knowlege of cleartext password. Make sure hashes
are stored and transmitted other network securely.

Also rlm_mschap implements generation of MPPE initial keys and related
attributes.

1. What does it do

The task for authorization part in RADIUS is to obtain user's parameters
from storage. For MS-CHAP you should either store NT-Password/LM-Password
in some source (LDAP, database, users file, SAMBA password file, etc) or
to store cleartext password. In second case cleartext should be converted
to NT/LM  hashes. To perform this task rlm_mschap should be included in
authorize{} section of config.cf (at the end of this section). Another
reason to include rlm_mschap in authorize{} is to auto-detect MS-CHAP
authentication attempt by specific attrbiutes. For this case 
	authtype = MS-CHAP
should be present in config section for mschap.

During authentication rlm_mschap checks challenge/response and adds
MPPE attributes (if required).

2. How should I configure it

First, edit config.cf file.

Config section parameters:

   authtype = MS-CHAP
 is only required if you want to allow user to select between MS-CHAP
 and other authentication type (such as PAP or CHAP). In this case you
 need to include mschap in authorize{} section. If mschap find attributes
 related to MS-CHAP authentication it will replace Auth-Type parameter
 with one specified in in authtype.

  use_mppe = no
  use_mppe = yes (default)
 If use_mppe set to no mschap will not generate MPPE-soecific attrbutes.
 MPPE is only used then you need data encryption (PPTP tunnel or PPP
 connection with data encryption supported by Microsoft RAS. For example
 you needn't MPPE if you use Cisco ASxxxx).

  require_encryption = no (default)
  require_encryption = yes
 if require_encryption set to no NAS will allow client to choose if he
 wants to encrypt data inside PPTP or PPP connection. If
 require_encryption = yes NAS will force data encryption and client
 without Microsoft data encryption support will be disconnected.

  require_strong = no (default)
  require_strong = yes
 if require_strong set to no client is allowed to use any key length, if
 yes only strong 128-bit keys are allowed.

Authorize{} section:

 You may want to include mschap in authorize{} section if either:
  - you need mschap was launched only if NAS requests MS-CHAP authentication
  - you store plain text passwords
 In last case mschap should follow the last module which retrieves user's
 information (for example after rlm_ldap if you store information in LDAP)

Authenticate{} section:

 Of cause, mschap should be included in authenticate{} section.

Second, you should place passwords or hashes in some place. Yes, you can use
SAMBA password file format (see rlm_passwd). If you prefer to store hashed
passwords you can use smbencrypt utility located in the src/modules/rlm_mschap.
Hint: use `cut` to obtain LM and NT hashes separately.

3. Known bugs:

 - Mschap doesn't work after upgrading from older FreeRADIUS version.
 The reason is dictionary incompatibility. Make sure to update
 dictionary.microsoft located in raddb directory.
 - Only ASCII passwords are supported.
 Unicode conversion is not fully implemented yet and passwords with
 extended characters will not work unless you exported NT/LM hashes
 from some some external source (for example from NT domain with pwdump).
 - FreeRADIUS doesn't correctly proxies MS-CHAP-MPPE-Keys reply for
 MS-CHAPv1 MPPE support between RRAS and ISA servers.
 Data in this attribute is encoded in a same fashion as User-Password
 attribute and attribute should be reassembled. FreeRADIUS architecture
 allows things like this (and it works for MS-CHAPv2 MPPE support), but
 for this specific type of encoding it's not implemented yet. If you
 really need this feature - call developers and it will be implemented.
 - 128 bit MPPE support is not implemented like RFC 3079 says.
 It's a bug of RFC 3079 commited by developers. Glenn Zorn <gwz@cisco.com>
 promised to submit the correction to RFC.


4. FAQ

Q: Can I use rlm_mschap to authenticate against NT or Win2K domain?
A: NO. rlm_mschap is supposed to perform MS-CHAP authentication, not
   authentication against domain.

Q: Can I migrate my dialup users from NT or Win2K domain to FreeRADIUS?
A: Yes. You can use pwdump2 utility by Todd Sabin to obtain NT/LM hashed
   passwords. Check http://www.packetstormsecurity.org for pwdump and same
   tools. This will produce SAMBA passwd file you can use with rlm_passwd
   module or you can export this data to some database.

Q: I see integrated support for SAMBA passwd format in rlm_mschap. May
   I use it?
A: You shouldn't, because this functionality is moved to rlm_passwd module
   and will be excluded from future rlm_mschap versions.

Q: Can I synchronize my SAMBA domain with NT/2K domain to obtain hashed
   passwords into passwd file or LDAP automatically?
A: At current time (Wed Jul 17 18:14:34 MSD 2002) SAMBA doesn't support
   BDC role and undocumented domain syncrhonization API. But the work is
   in progress. If somebody really interested it's really possible to
   create a daemon based on pwdump2 code which will dump NT/LM hashes from
   domain controller to file or to give 'em other the network by request.
