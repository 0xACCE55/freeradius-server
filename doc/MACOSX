	Installing FreeRADIUS on MAC OSX
	--------------------------------

0) download, unzip and untar freeradius.tar.gz

1) $ ./configure --disable-shared   (So static libraries are built)

2) $ cd ./src

3) $ make

4) There may be issues building the rlm_eap module.  The simplest way
   to work around them is to delete the src/modules/rlm_eap directory.

5) $ make install

6) Now run radiusd -X and test things out with radtest, as specified
in the FAQ.

7) Assuming everything works, set up your clients.conf and other config
files as appropriate to suit your needs and set radiusd to run on boot and
you're done.

That's about it.  FreeRADIUS works for me and I'm happy now.  :-)
