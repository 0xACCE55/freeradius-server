	Installing FreeRADIUS on MAC OSX
	--------------------------------

0) download, unzip and untar freeradius.tar.gz

1) $ ./configure --disable-shared   (So static libraries are built)

2) Modify ./src/include/sysutmp.h to #undef HAVE_UTMP_H

For 0.7 or earlier: 

  3) Modify ./src/modules/rlm_pam/rlm_pam.c to
     change the include directive from #include <security/pam_appl.h> to
     #include <pam/pam_appl.h>

   4) Modify ./src/modules/rlm_sql/drivers/rlm_sql_iodbc/sql_iodbc.c, line 214
   to change the return type of that function to SQL_ROW so it matches
   the function prototype in sql_iodbc.h.  One could also instead
   change the return type to int in the header file sql_iodbc.h.

Steps (3) and (4) should NOT be necessary for 0.8 and later.

5) $ cd ./src

6) $ make

7) $ make install

For 0.7 or earlier:

  8) Modify radiusd.conf as follows:

    In the unix section:

    8a) set "cache = no"
    8b) set "cache_reload = 0"
    8c) COMMENT OUT the "passwd =", "shadow =", and "group =" lines.
    8d) Save changes and exit whatever editor you used to edit radiusd.conf.

Step (8) should NOT be necessary for 0.8 and later.

9) Now run radiusd -X and test things out with radtest, as specified
in the FAQ.

10) Assuming everything works, set up your clients.conf and other config
files as appropriate to suit your needs and set radiusd to run on boot and
you're done.

That's about it.  FreeRADIUS works for me and I'm happy now.  :-)
