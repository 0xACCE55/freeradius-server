This is now called Post-Auth-Type, for consistency.

Post-Auth-Type is used to select between groupings of
modules in the post-auth stanza using arbitrary attributes.
It is functionally identical to Acct-Type, apart from
the name of the attribute. This means that (unlike
Autz-Type) the attribute must be set before the stanza
is run. Changes to Post-Auth-Type during post-auth will
have no effect.
