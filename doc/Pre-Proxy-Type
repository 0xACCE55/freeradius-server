Pre-Proxy-Type is used to select between groupings of
modules in the pre-proxy stanza using arbitrary attributes.
It is functionally identical to Acct-Type, apart from
the name of the attribute. This means that (unlike
Autz-Type) the attribute must be set before the stanza
is run. Changes to Pre-Proxy-Type during pre-proxy will
have no effect.
