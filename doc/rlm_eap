  A summary of how EAP works, as posted to the list by
John Lindsay <jlindsay@internode.com.au>

To make it clear for everyone, the supplicant is the software on the client 
(machine with the wireless card).

The EAP process doesn't start until the client has associated with the 
Access Point using Open authentication.  If this process isn't crystal 
clear you need to go away and gain understanding.

Once the association is made the AP blocks all traffic that is not 802.1x 
so although associated the connection only has value for EAP.  Any EAP 
traffic is passed to the radius server and any radius traffic is passed 
back to the client.

So, after the client has associated to the Access Point, the supplicant 
starts the process for using EAP over LAN by asking the user for their 
logon and password.

Using 802.1x and EAP the supplicant sends the username and a one-way hash 
of the password to the AP.

The AP encapsulates the request and sends it to the RADIUS server.

The radius server needs a plaintext password so that it can perform the 
same one-way hash to determine that the password is correct.  If it is, the 
radius server issues an access challenge which goes back via to the AP to 
the client. (my study guide says client but my brain says 'supplicant')

The client sends the EAP response to the challenge via the AP to the RADIUS 
server.

If the response is valid the RADIUS server sends a success message and the 
session WEP key (EAP over wireless) to the client via the AP.  The same 
session WEP key is also sent to the AP in the success packet.

The client and the AP then begin using session WEP keys. The WEP key used 
for multicasts is then sent from the AP to the client.  It is encrypted 
using the session WEP key.
