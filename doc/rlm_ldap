1.   INSTALATION

This module depends on OpenLDAP v2.0 SDK libraries.
For details on obtaining source of OpenLDAP look at <http://www.openldap.org>.
OpenLDAP SDK in turn depends on OpenSSL crypto libraries and (optionaly) on 
Cyrus-SASL libraries.

2. CONFIGURATION

Add following subsection to the modules{} section of radiusd.conf to control
the rlm_ldap module:

  modules {
	...
	
	ldap {

#	server: space separated list of host[:port]
#	default: settings for your system, as set in etc/openldap/ldap.conf
#
		server   = localhost

#	net_timeout: # of seconds to wait for response of the server 
#			(network failures)
#	default: forever
#
		net_timeout = 1

#	timeout: # seconds to wait for LDAP query to finish
#	default: forever
#
		timeout = 2

#	identity: DN under which LDAP searches are done
#	password: pasword which authenticate this DN
#	default: anonymous bind, no password required
#	NOTE: searches are done now over unencrypted connection!
#
#	identity = "cn=admin,o=My Org,c=UA"
#	password = mypass

#	basedn = <Base of LDAP searches>
#
		basedn   = "o=My Org,c=UA"

#	filter: LDAP search filter, to locate user object using name
#	supplied by client during Radius authentication
#	
#	default: none
		filter   = "(uid=%u)"

#	access_group: membership in this group controls radius access for user
#	default: NULL 
#	(means all users located in the LDAP tree under specified "basedn")
#	
		access_group = "cn=RemoteUsers,o=My Org,c=UA"

#	access_attr: if attribute is specified, module checks for its existance
#	in user object. If it exists and is set to TRUE, user is allowed to get
#	remote access.
#	default: NULL - don't check for the attribute
		access_attr = "dialupAccess"
	}
}

NOTE:
As LDAP is case insensitive, you should probably also set "lower_user = yes" 
and "lower_time = before" in main section of radiusd.conf, to get limits on 
simultaneous logins working correctly. Otherwise, users will be able get large 
number of sessions, capitalizing parts of their login names.

As attempts to standardize LDAP attributes for RADIUS has failed (or stalled),
currently I propose to set all necessary attributes in users file with 
following authorize section of radiusd.conf :

authorize { 
	preprocess
	realm
	ldap {
		notfound = return
	} 
	files  
}
