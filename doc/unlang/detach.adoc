== The detach Statement

.Syntax
[source,unlang]
----
detach
----

The `detach` statement is used to separare a child request from a
parent request.  The `detach` statement can only be used inside of a
link:subrequest.adoc[subrequest] section.

Once a child request is detached from the parent, the parent can
continue execution independently of the child.  However, once a child
request is detached from the parent request, the child can no longer
access any attributes in the parent.

.Example
[source,unlang]
----
subrequest Disconnect-Request {
    update request {
        &User-Name := &parent.request:User-Name
        &NAS-IP-Address := &parent.request:NAS-IP-Address
        &NAS-Port := &parent.request:NAS-Port
        &Acct-Session-Id := &parent.request:Acct-Session-Id
    }

    detach
