= The load-balance Statement

[source,unlang]
----
load-balance {
    [ module-1 ]
    [ module-2 ]
}
----

The `load-balance` section is similar to the `redundant` section
except that only one module in the subsection is ever called. The
module is chosen randomly, in a "load balanced" manner.

In general, the link:redundant-load-balance.adoc[redundant-load-balance]
statement is more useful than this one.

*Examples:*

[source,unlang]
----
load-balance {
    sql1
    sql2
}
