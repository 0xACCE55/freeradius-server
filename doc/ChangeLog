FreeRADIUS 2.0.3 ; $Date$ , urgency=medium
	Feature improvements
	* Updated raddb/certs/ca.cnf with extensions to allow ca.der
	  to be imported as a CA on Symbian and Windows Mobile devices.
	  Closes bug #524
	* Enable multiple matches in "hints" via Fall-Through = Yes.
	  Closes bug #477
	* Added preliminary SQLite driver, contibuted by Apple.
	  Untested, with no sample configuration.  This address bug #470.
	* Updated logging sub-system so that log messages from libfreeradius
	  can go to the log file, and not stdout.
	* Added dictionary.rfc5176
	* EAP module now checks for instance name, and uses that for
	  authentication.  This avoids the need to set Auth-Type when
	  there are multiple instances of the EAP module.
	* Added Module-Return-Code attribute, which contains the value
	  returned by the previous module (ok/fail/update/etc.)

	Bug fixes
	* Corrected typos in rlm_dbm.  Closes bugs #521 and #522.
	* Detail file "listen" sections now work much better.
	* Don't allow old "log_*" to over-ride new format.  Closes bug #525
	* Initialize allocated memory in Oracle SQL driver.  This fixes
	  occasional crashes on some systems.  Closes bug #518
	* Call correct function in rlm_protocol_filter.  This enables the
	  module to build.  Closes bug #512.
	* Added deprecated flag to build for rlm_krb5.  This allows it to
	  run on 64-bit systems.  Closes bug #491
	* Corrected error message when parsing invalid configurations
	  so it doesn't crash.  Closes bug #527
	* Fix handling of timeouts in rlm_ldap that affected 64-bit systems.
	* Handle $INCLUDE's in "instantiate" section.  Closes #528.
	* Format updates to "man" pages from Stephen Gran.

FreeRADIUS 2.0.2 ; Date: 2008/02/14 11:13:48  , urgency=medium
	Feature improvements
	* Added notes on how to debug the server in radiusd.conf
	* Moved all "log_*" in radiusd.conf to log{} section.
	  The old configurations are still accepted, though.
	* Added ca.der target in raddb/certs/Makefile.  This is
	  needed for importing CA certs into Windows.
	* Added ability send raw attributes via "Raw-Attribute = 0x0102..."
	  This is available only debug builds.  It can be used
	  to create invalid packets! Use it with care.
	* Permit "unlang" policies inside of Auth-Type{} sub-sections
	  of the authenticate{} section.  This makes some policies easier
	  to implement.
	* "listen" sections can now have "type = proxy".  This lets you
	  control which IP is used for sending proxied requests.
	* Added note on SSL performance to raddb/certs/README

	Bug fixes
	* Fixed reading of "detail" files.
	* Allow inner EAP tunneled sessions to be proxied.
	* Corrected MySQL schemas
	* syslog now works in log{} section.
	* Corrected typo in raddb/certs/client.cnf
	* Updated raddb/sites-available/proxy-inner-tunnel to
	  permit authentication to work.
	* Ignore zero-length attributes in received packets.
	* Correct memcpy when dealing with unknown attributes.
	* Corrected debugging messages in attr_rewrite.
	* Corrected generation of State attribute in EAP.  This
	  fixes the "failed to remember handler" issues.
	* Fall back to DEFAULT realm if no realm was found.
	  Based on a patch from Vincent Magnin.
	* Updated example raddb/sites-available/proxy-inner-tunnel
	* Corrected behavior of attr_filter to match documentation.
	  This is NOT backwards compatible with previous versions!
	  See "man rlm_attr_filter" for details.

FreeRADIUS 2.0.1 ; Date: 2008/01/22 13:29:37  , urgency=low
	Feature improvements
	* "unlang" has been expanded to do less run-time expansion,
	  and to have better handling of typed data.  See "man unlang"
	  for documentation and new examples.
	
	Bug fixes
	* The 'acct_unique' module has been updated to understand
	  the deprecated (but still used) Client-IP-Address attribute.
	* The EAP-MSCHAPv2 module no longer leaks MS-CHAP2-Success in
	  packets.
	* Fixed crash in rlm_dbm.
	* Fixed parsing of syslog configuration.

FreeRADIUS 2.0.0 ; Date: 2007/11/24 08:33:09 , urgency=low
	Feature improvements
	* Debugging mode is much clearer and easier to read.
        * A new policy language makes many configurations trivial.
	  See "man unlang" for a complete description.
	* Virtual servers are now supported.  This permits clear separation
	  of policies.  See raddb/sites-available/README
	* EAP-TLS (PEAP, EAP-TTLS) and OpenSSL certificates "just work".
	  See raddb/certs/README for details.
	* Proxying is much more configurable than before.
	  See proxy.conf for documentation on pools, and new config items.
	* Full support for IPv6.
	* Much more complete support for the RADIUS SNMP MIBs.
	* HUP now works.  Only some modules are re-loaded,
	  and the server configuation is *not* reloaded.
	* "check config" option now works.  See "man radiusd"
	* radrelay functionality is now included in the server core.
	  See raddb/sites-available/copy-acct-to-home-server
	* VMPS support.  It is minimal, but functional.
	* Cleaned up internal API's and names, including library names.
	
	Bug fixes
	* Many.
