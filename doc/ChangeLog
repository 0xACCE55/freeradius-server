	* Initialize variables properly in rlm_attr_filter.
	  Patch from Andriy I Pilipenko <bamby@marka.net.ua>

	  This allows it to work properly with the RedHat rc system.
	  Patch from Christian Vogel <chris@amor.iksys.de>
	* Fix the configure script checks for PostgreSQL, so that
	  they use the 'test' command properly.
	  Bug found by Robert Haskins <rhaskins@ziplink.net>
	* Change instances of 'assert' to 'rad_assert', so that it
	  can log the error to the standard radius log files.
	  Patch from Vesselin Atanasov <vesselin@bgnet.bg>
	* Patch to prevent segv when freeing results, from
	  Tomas Heredia <tomas@intermediasp.com>
	* Added support for Exec-Program to acct.  Bug found by
	  <magmike@mail.ru>
	* Corrected rlm_files so that raddb/acct_users works
        * When doing synchronous proxying, update proxy next try
	  entries, so that the server doesn't eat CPU time.
	  Raghu <raghud@hereuare.com>
	* Add primitive dictionary.nomadix <CBoyd@apogeetelecom.com>
	* Log messages to console, if the logger hasn't been
	  initialized.  <vesselin@bgnet.bg>
	* Log invalid user for proxy rejects, too. <help@visp.net>
	* Fixed Expiration attribute handling.
	* Added code to handle Ascend-Send-Secret and Ascend-Receive-Secret
	* Removed non thread-pool code.  If we have threads, we now force
	  the use of thread pools.
	* Update version number
	* correct bug where proxied accounting packets would never have a
	  reply sent back to the NAS, or the reply would be sent twice.

FreeRADIUS Alpha 0.2.0, July 30, 2001.

	* call openlog() again when using PAM, to get the correct log
	facility.
	* Update child thread code, to minimize race conditions.
	* Make thread pools the default.  Using plain child threads is NOT
	recommended.
	* Ignore SIGPIPE to get ride of crashes when using ldap.
	* Update proxying code to work better.
	* Platform independent pthread_cancel()ling
	* Fix 'unresponsive child pid' erroneous warning messages.
	* Many changes to get various SQL modules working.
	Note that there may still be some issues with Oracle.
	* Added configure options 'with-rlm-FOO-include/lib-dir', so that
	lower-level rlm_FOO modules can be configured via the top-level
	configuration file.  This isn't completely done yet.
	* Fix check for shared library using libtool info, instead of
	assuming extension being ".so".
	* Fixes for HPUX.  We probably need more.
	* Many additional bug fixes and changes.
