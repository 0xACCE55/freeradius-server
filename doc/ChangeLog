FreeRADIUS 2.0.0 ; $Date$, urgency=low
	Feature improvements over v1.x.y
	* Debugging mode is much clearer and easier to read.
	* EAP-TLS and OpenSSL certificates "just work".
	  See raddb/certs/README for details.
	* Proxying works much better than in 1.x.y.
	  See proxy.conf for documentation on pools, and new config items.
	* Full support for IPv6.
	* Much more complete support for the RADIUS SNMP MIBs.
        * A new policy language makes many configurations trivial.
