FreeRADIUS 2.2.4 Wednesday 16 Dec 2013 15:00:00 EST, urgency=medium
	Feature improvements
	Bug fixes
	* Exit with error code if child fails to complete 
	  server initialisation after forking.  This allows init
	  scripts to correctly report whether the server started ok.

FreeRADIUS 2.2.3 Wednesday 11 Dec 2013 15:00:00 EST, urgency=medium
	Feature improvements
	* Added dictionary.efficientip, dictionary.alcatel-lucent-aaa
	* Allow zero length DN strings in rlm_ldap.
	* If Password-With-Header has no header, assume it is
	  Cleartext-Password.

	Bug fixes
	* Make the server build when DHCP is enabled
	* Don't crash if there's no Post-Proxy-Type Reject.
	* Use correct fields for X509 attributes in certificates
	* Install threads.h making it possible to link against the
	  installed headers again.
	* Initialize SSL once in "main", instead of rlm_eap_tls.
	  Some client libraries may need SSL.

FreeRADIUS 2.2.2 Wednesday 30 Oct 2013 9:30:00 DST, urgency=medium
	Feature improvements
	* Add "timeout" to exec, and "ntlm_auth_timeout" to mschap.
	  So that run-away child processes are caught earlier.
	* Print out thread number for "unresponsive child".

	Bug fixes
	* Fix erroneous fall-through in "case" statements
	* Fix priority handling in new module handling code
	* Fix threading issue with Perl.  Closes #436
	* Fix EAP-TLS check_cert_issuer when X509v2 extensions
	  existed.  Patch from David Wood.
	* Fix pointer references in rlm_python.
	* Fix "unresponsive child" issue when proxying.
	* Set log output correctly when using -l.
	  Fix ported from 3.0.0.
	* Buffer debug output when threaded, so that text from
	  different threads isn't interspersed.
	* Fix SEGV in rlm_perl when using dynamic expansions.
	* Fix build for OSX Mavericks, which hid the header files
	  in a magical place.
	* Port DHCP fixes from 3.0.

FreeRADIUS 2.2.1 Tuesday 17 Sep 2013 12:00:00 CEST, urgency=medium
	Feature improvements
	* Updated dictionaries for alcatel, broadsoft, bskyb, dlink, meru,
	  telkom, trapeze, proxim, zeus, rfc6677, 6911, and rfc6930.
	* Added %{randstr:..} support. Creates random strings in a
	  controllable format.
	* Added operator support to rlm_python
	* Added %{hex:...} for hex version of raw attribute data
	* Added %{sha1:...} for SHA1 hashing of data
	* Added %{base64:...} for raw attribute data (e.g. 32-bit IP addr),
	  and %{tobase64:...} for the printable string form (e.g. 1.2.3.4),
	  and %{base64tohex:...} to convert a base64 string to a hex string.
	* rlm_expr is now responsible for registering many of the xlat
	  expansions. This is cleaner than bundling them all in the server
	  core. You should ensure 'expr' is listed in instantiate to ensure
	  correct operation of xlat expansions.
	* Use correct terminology when printing errors regarding request/
	  response/message authenticators.
	* Added keytab support to Heimdal Kerberos. Patch from Ryan Steinmetz.
	* radsqlrelay does multiple INSERTs in one transaction.
	  Patch from Uwe Meyer-Gruhl.
	* Run Post-Proxy-Type Reject {} if the upstream server rejected the
	  request.
	* On startup, the server checks if it was linked with th
