	  <magmike@mail.ru>
	* Corrected rlm_files so that raddb/acct_users works
        * When doing synchronous proxying, update proxy next try

FreeRADIUS Alpha 0.2.0, July 30, 2001.

	* call openlog() again when using PAM, to get the correct log
	facility.
	* Update child thread code, to minimize race conditions.
	* Make thread pools the default.  Using plain child threads is NOT
	recommended.
	* Ignore SIGPIPE to get ride of crashes when using ldap.
	* Update proxying code to work better.
	* Platform independent pthread_cancel()ling
	* Fix 'unresponsive child pid' erroneous warning messages.
	* Many changes to get various SQL modules working.
	Note that there may still be some issues with Oracle.
	* Added configure options 'with-rlm-FOO-include/lib-dir', so that
	lower-level rlm_FOO modules can be configured via the top-level
	configuration file.  This isn't completely done yet.
	* Fix check for shared library using libtool info, instead of
	assuming extension being ".so".
	* Fixes for HPUX.  We probably need more.
	* Many additional bug fixes and changes.
