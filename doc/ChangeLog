FreeRADIUS 3.2.1 Thu 21 Apr 2021 12:00:00 EDT urgency=low
	Feature improvements
	* Add dictionary.ciena, and DHCPv4 dictionaries,
	* Add simultaneous-use queries for MS SQL.
	* Add radmin command for "stats pool <module-name>"
	  Which prints out statistics about the connection pools
	* Client statistics now shows "conflicts", to count conflicting
	  packets.
	* New optional "lightweight accounting-on/off" strategy.  When
	  refreshing queries.conf you should also add the new nasreload table
	  and corresponding GRANTs to your DB schema.
	* Add TLS-Client-Cert-X509v3-Certificate-Policies, which helps with
	  Eduroam.  Suggested by Stefan Winter.
	* Allow auth+acct for TCP sockets, too.
	* Add rlm_cache_redis. See raddb/mods-available/cache for details
	* Allow radnmin to look up home servers by name, too.
	* Ensure that dynamic clients don't create loops on duplicates.
	  Reported by Sam Yee.
	* Removed rlm_sqlhpwippool.  There was no documentation, no configuration,
	  and the module was ~15 years old with no one using it.

	Bug fixes
	* Correct test for open sessions in radacct for MS SQL.
	* The linelog module now opens /dev/stdout in "write-only" mode
	  if the permissions are set to "u+w" (0002).

FreeRADIUS 3.2.0 Thu 21 Apr 2021 12:00:00 EDT urgency=low
	Configuration changes
	* "correct_escapes" has been removed, and is always set to "true"
	  internally. Configuration changes may be required if you are
	  using configurations from before 3.0.5.  Other than this
	  difference, 3.2.x is compatible with 3.0.x, and configurations
	  from 3.0.x can be simply copied into a system running 3.2.x.

	Feature improvements
	* All features from 3.0.x are included in the 3.2.x releases. In addition:
	* Add 'reset_day' and '%%r' parameter for rlm_sqlcounter to specify which
	  day of the month the counter should be reset.
	* Partial backport of rlm_json from v4, providing the json_encode xlat.
	  See mods-available/json for documentation.
	* Support for haproxy "PROXY" protocol.
	  See sites-available/tls, "proxy_protocol" and doc/antora/modules/howto/pages/protocols/proxy/
	* Support for sending CoA-Request and Disconnect-Request packets
	  in "reverse" down RadSec tunnels.  Experimental for now, and
	  undocumented.
	* It is now possible to run a virtual server when saving / loading
	  TLS cache attributes.  See sites-available/tls-cache for
	  more information.
	* Removed the "cram" module.  It was undocumented, and used old
	  and insecure authentication methods.
	* Remove the "otp" module.  The "otpd" program it needs is no longer available,
	  and the module has not been usable since at least 2015.
	* All features from 3.0.x are included in the 3.2.x releases.
	* 3.2.0 requires OpenSSL 1.0.2 or greater.

	Bug fixes
	* All bug fixes from 3.0.x are included in the 3.2.x releases.
