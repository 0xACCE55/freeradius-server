FreeRADIUS 3.2.0 Thu 07 Oct 2021 12:00:00 EDT urgency=low
	Feature improvements
	* You can take the 3.0 configuration files, and use them in
	  3.2 without any changes.
	* The only difference is that "correct_escapes" has been removed,
	  and is always set to "true" internally.
	* Add 'reset_day' and '%%r' parameter for rlm_sqlcounter to specify which
	  day of the month the counter should be reset.
	* Add dictionary.mellanox

	Bug fixes
