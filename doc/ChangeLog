	Feature improvements
	* Support for RADIUS over TLS (i.e. RadSec).
	  See raddb/sites-available/tls
	* Can send SNMP Traps.  See raddb/trigger.conf.

	  much simpler and easier to extend.

	* Re-arranged configuration entries in radiusd.conf to make more
	  sense.
	* Moved raddb/modules/ to raddb/mods-available, and raddb/mods-enabled
	  See raddb/README.rst for more information.
	* Moved eap.conf to mods-available/eap
	* Moved sql.conf to mods-available/sql
	* Preliminary support for Apple's Grand Central Dispatch.
	* Added provisions for raddb/dictionary.local, for local changes.
	  See raddb/dictionary for more details.
	* EAP-PWD implementation from Dan Harkins
	* Largely config-file compatible with 2.1.x.
	* Upgrade instructions are in raddb/README.rst
