FreeRADIUS 3.0.0 Mon 01 Jan 8:00:00 CEST 2010, urgency=medium
	Feature improvements
	* Support for RADIUS over TLS (i.e. RadSec).
	  See raddb/sites-available/tls
	* SNMP Traps.  See raddb/trigger.conf.
	* Re-written packet encode/decoder.  The resulting code is
	  much simpler and easier to extend.
	* Complete WiMAX support, using new encoder/decoder.  The old code
	  could not handle some unusual corner cases.
	* Support for "extended attributes" using new encoder/decoder.
	* Support for "integer64" data type.
	* Updated internal API to support new attributes
	* Re-arranged configuration entries in radiusd.conf to make more
	  sense.
	* Moved eap.conf to modules/eap
	* Moved sql.conf to modules/sql
	* Preliminary support for Apple's Grand Central Dispatch.
	* Largely config-file compatible with 2.1.x.

	Bug fixes
	* All known bug fixes are included.
