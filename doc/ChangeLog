	Feature improvements
	* Initial pre-release of 2.0.
	* Debugging mode is much clearer and easier to read.
	* EAP-TLS and OpenSSL certificates "just work".
	  See raddb/certs/README for details.
	* Proxying works much better than in 1.x.  We mean *MUCH* better.
	  See proxy.conf for details.

	  See "man rlm_unix" for details.
	* The server has full support for IPv6.
	* The server has much more complete support for SNMP MIBs.
	* radiusd.conf has limited support for "if/then/else".
	  See doc/configurable_failover for details.
	* "listen" sections can have per-socket clients.
	* Replaced "radrelay" and "radsqlrelay".
	  See "man radrelay.conf" for details.
	* Post-Proxy-Type "Fail" section is executed when a home server
	  fails to respond to a request.  See "radiusd.conf" for details.
	* Many internal data structures have been updated to use trees
	  rather than linked lists for performance.
	* "virtual" modules can now be used.
	  See "virtual" in the "instantiate" section of "radiusd.conf".
	* The server header files have been cleaned up.
	* Configuration files can now "$INCLUDE directory/", to automatically
	  load all files in that directory.  Use with caution!
