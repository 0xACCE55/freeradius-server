FreeRADIUS 2.0.0 ; $Date$, urgency=low
	Feature improvements
	* Debugging mode is much clearer and easier to read.
        * A new policy language makes many configurations trivial.
	  See "man unlang" for a complete description.
	* Virtual servers are now supported.  This permits clear separation
	  of policies.  See raddb/sites-available/README
	* EAP-TLS (PEAP, EAP-TTLS) and OpenSSL certificates "just work".
	  See raddb/certs/README for details.
	* Proxying is much more configurable than before.
	  See proxy.conf for documentation on pools, and new config items.
	* Full support for IPv6.
	* Much more complete support for the RADIUS SNMP MIBs.
	* HUP now works.  Only some modules are re-loaded,
	  and the server configuation is *not* reloaded.
	* "check config" option now works.  See "man radiusd"
	* radrelay functionality is now included in the server core.
	  See raddb/sites-available/copy-acct-to-home-server
	* VMPS support.  It is minimal, but functional.
	* Cleaned up internal API's and names, including library names.
	
	Bug fixes
	* Many.
