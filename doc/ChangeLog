FreeRADIUS 0.5.0 ; $Date$, urgency=medium

	* Many bug fixes.  For explicit details, see:
		http://www.freeradius.org/cvs-log/
	* Added Foundry dictionary, from Thomas Keitel
	* Fix a logic bug in the 'walk over request list' code, which
	  would sometimes result in a request being deleted while it
	  was still being processed.  Found by Rainer Clasen
	* New 'tuning' guide, for optimizing the server's speed.
	* The default ports are now 1812/1813, which is the standard.
	* Fix a bug which would hang the server when many SQL connections
	  were open.  Found by Cvetan Ivanov <zezo@spnet.net>
	* Updated MySQL schema, with sanity checks, based on a schema from
	  Thomas Huehn <huehn@eozaen.net>
	* Added 'Aptis' (Nortel CVX) dictionary.
	* Added Ipv6 attributes (as 'octets' type for now)
	* 'xlat' capability for SQL, so other modules can do SQL queries.
	* We don't need a shared secret for LOCAL realms.
	* Added better description of internal variables.
	* Configurable fail-over to DEFAULT realm.  Sometimes we don't
	  want to use the DEFAULT realm, if all configured realms are
	  marked dead.  From Rainer Clasen.
	* new configuration items 'max_attributes' and 'reject_delay'
	  If the packet contains too many attributes, it can be rejected.
	  We can also delay sending an Access-Reject, which slows down
	  certain DoS attacks.
	* Updates to redhat scripts and spec file, from Marko Myllynen.
	* Python module (EXPERIMENTAL) from migs paraz <mparaz@yahoo.com>
	* Add ability to find *best* match when comparing attributes.
	  If there is more than one attribute in a request and the first
	  one doesn't match, go check the second one, instead of failing.
	* unixODBC support for SQL, from Dmitri Ageev <d_ageev@ortcc.ru>
	* Use thread-safe versions of library calls.  This work is still
	  on-going.
	* New rlm_passwd module, to allow general parsing of passwd-style
	  files.
	* Preliminary EAP-TLS support.
	* Updated LDAPv3 schema
	* Correct checks for Odbc, and fix bugs in the module.
	  Andreas Kainz <aka@maxxio.at>
	* MAN page fixes and updates
	* Added PHP web interface 'dialup_admin'
	* Password = "UNIX" or "PAM" backwards compatibility removed.
	* Use the operators in the SQL schema and queries, and bug
	  fixes in the SQL module.
	  Randy Moore <ramoore@axion-it.net>
	* fgetpwent() compatibility, for systems without it,
	  from Daniel Carroll <freeradius@defiant.mesastate.edu>
	* Added PAP authentication module, as a step to removing
	  most authentication handlers in other modules.
	* Send a Access-Reject after max_request_time
	* Multiple fixes in the LDAP module.
	* Quintum dictionary by Jeremy McNamara <jj@indie.org>
	* Preliminary EAP Module with MD5 support
	  Contributed by Raghu <raghud@hereuare.com>
	* Better sanity checking for bad VSA's when receiving a packet
	* new 'xlat register' so that attribute values may be pulled
	  out of configurable databases at run-time.
	  e.g. %{ldap:ldap:///dc=company,dc=com?uid?sub?uid=%u}
	* Minor fixes to debian package rules
	* Attribute 'Password' deprecated in favor of 'User-Password'.
	* MS-CHAP and MS-CHAPv2 MPPE support added.
	  Contributed by Takahiro Wagatsuma <waga@sic.shibaura-it.ac.jp>.
	* X9.9 token enhancements (several).

FreeRADIUS 0.4.0 ; urgency=low

	* Allow the MS-CHAP module to work, and to read /etc/smbpass
	  3APA3A <3APA3A@SECURITY.NNOV.RU>
	* Remove the server requirement that one of User-Password
	  or CHAP-Password exist when doing authentication.  These
	  checks should be handled by the modules.  This change
	  also prepares us for EAP.
	  Patch from Raghu <raghud@hereuare.com>
	* Make NAS-Port-ID in radwho, raduse, etc. unsigned,
	  instead of signed.
	  Patch from John Morrissey <jwm@horde.net>
	* Allow \t and \n inside of configuration strings.
	  Frank Cusack <fcusack@fcusack.com>
	* X9.9 Challenge-Response token card support.
	  For now, only CRYPTOCard tokens are supported.
	  Frank Cusack <fcusack@fcusack.com>
	* Fix core dump on Solaris in radwho.c
	  Patch from Eddie Stassen <eddies@saix.net>
	* Fix leak / core dump in Oracle module.
	* Fix memory leak in rlm_counter
	  Kostas Kalevras <kkalev@noc.ntua.gr>
	* "LOCAL" realms do not need to have an entry in the 'clients'
	  file.  Philippe Levan <levan@epix.net>

  --  Alan DeKok <aland@ox.org>

FreeRADIUS 0.3.0 ; urgency=low

	* Added ability to send debug messages to the log file, when
	  running in daemon mode.
	* Miscellaneous fixes to get Debian packaging working.
	* When trapping a signal, don't SIGKILL children on a SIGTERM,
	  SIGTERM them, instead.  This allows Exec-Program scripts to
	  catch the signal, and finish processing, instead of dying.
	  Bug noted by Michael Chernyakhovsky <magmike@mail.ru>
	* Increased limit on length of user name read from /etc/passwd,
	  to match the maximum allowed by RADIUS.
	  Bug noted by "Gonzalez B., Fernando" <fgonzalez@manquehue.cl>
	* Configurable fail-over when proxying packets.  If the
	  home server doesn't respond to a repeated proxied request,
	  it's marked as 'dead', and the next one in the list is used.
	  Patch by Eddie Stassen <eddies@saix.net> and <spirn@21cn.com>
	* Pass Access-Challenge attributes through the server, in
	  preparation for EAP.
	  Raghu <raghud@hereuare.com>
	* More fixes for RFC compliance on the Message-Authenticator
	  Raghu <raghud@hereuare.com>
	* Merged OSFC2/OSFSIA authentication patches from Cistron.
	  (Bug # 104)  The patches are not well tested, however.
	* IBM DB2 UDB V7.1 SQL driver, contributed by
	  Joerg Wendland <wendland@scan-plus.de>
	* Fix the IP + Port address assignment.
	  Bug found by "John Padula" <john_padula@aviancommunications.com>
	* Patch to avoid smashing the contents of Ascend binary filters.
	  Michael Chernyakhovsky <magmike@mail.ru>
	* Create and Validate Message-Authenticator attribute, in
	  preparation for EAP.
	* Initialize variables properly in rlm_attr_filter.
	  Patch from Andriy I Pilipenko <bamby@marka.net.ua>
	* Renamed RedHat init script from 'radiusd.init' to 'radiusd'.
	  This allows it to work properly with the RedHat rc system.
	  Patch from Christian Vogel <chris@amor.iksys.de>
	* Fix the configure script checks for PostgreSQL, so that
	  they use the 'test' command properly.
	  Bug found by Robert Haskins <rhaskins@ziplink.net>
	* Change instances of 'assert' to 'rad_assert', so that it
	  can log the error to the standard radius log files.
	  Patch from Vesselin Atanasov <vesselin@bgnet.bg>
	* Patch to prevent segv when freeing results, from
	  Tomas Heredia <tomas@intermediasp.com>
	* Added support for Exec-Program to acct.  Bug found by
	  <magmike@mail.ru>
	* Corrected rlm_files so that raddb/acct_users works
        * When doing synchronous proxying, update proxy next try
	  entries, so that the server doesn't eat CPU time.
	  Raghu <raghud@hereuare.com>
	* Add primitive dictionary.nomadix <CBoyd@apogeetelecom.com>
	* Log messages to console, if the logger hasn't been
	  initialized.  <vesselin@bgnet.bg>
	* Log invalid user for proxy rejects, too. <help@visp.net>
	* Fixed Expiration attribute handling.
	* Added code to handle Ascend-Send-Secret and Ascend-Receive-Secret
	* Removed non thread-pool code.  If we have threads, we now force
	  the use of thread pools.
	* Update version number
	* correct bug where proxied accounting packets would never have a
	  reply sent back to the NAS, or the reply would be sent twice.

FreeRADIUS Alpha 0.2.0, July 30, 2001.

	* call openlog() again when using PAM, to get the correct log
	facility.
	* Update child thread code, to minimize race conditions.
	* Make thread pools the default.  Using plain child threads is NOT
	recommended.
	* Ignore SIGPIPE to get ride of crashes when using ldap.
	* Update proxying code to work better.
	* Platform independent pthread_cancel()ling
	* Fix 'unresponsive child pid' erroneous warning messages.
	* Many changes to get various SQL modules working.
	Note that there may still be some issues with Oracle.
	* Added configure options 'with-rlm-FOO-include/lib-dir', so that
	lower-level rlm_FOO modules can be configured via the top-level
	configuration file.  This isn't completely done yet.
	* Fix check for shared library using libtool info, instead of
	assuming extension being ".so".
	* Fixes for HPUX.  We probably need more.
	* Many additional bug fixes and changes.
