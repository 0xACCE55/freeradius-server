Session-Type is used to select between groupings of
modules using arbitrary attributes. It is similar
to Autz-Type, but an update to Session-Type by a module
in the session stanza will cause the named grouping
to be immediately executed.

This allows Simultaneous-Use checking behaviour to be very flexible.
