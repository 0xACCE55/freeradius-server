		Cisco IOS 11.x and Radius

For Cisco 11.1, you normally use

   aaa new-model
   aaa authentication ppp radppp if-needed radius
   aaa authorization network radius none
   aaa accounting network wait-start radius

to get the Cisco to talk to a radius server.

With IOS 11.3, you need to add:

   aaa accounting update newinfo

If you want the IP address of the user to show up in the radutmp file
(and thus, the output of "radwho").

This is because with IOS 11.3, the Cisco first sends a "Start" accounting
packet without the IP address included. By setting "update newinfo" it
will send an account "Alive" packet which updates the information. Cistron
Radius understands the "Alive" packet since 1.5.4.3-beta7.


Als you might see a lot of "duplicates" in the logfile. That can be
fixed by

   aaa accounting network wait radius
   radius-server timeout 3
