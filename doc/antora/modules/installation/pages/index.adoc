== Installation

We recommend installing FreeRADIUS via the pre-built packages available
from http://packages.networkradius.com[Network RADIUS]. Many Operating
System distributions ship versions of FreeRADIUS which are years out of
date. That page contains recent FreeRADIUS packages for all common OS
distributions. For historical purposes, packages of older releases are
also available from that site.

The rest of this document describes how to install FreeRADIUS from
source. i.e. a "tar.gz" file.
