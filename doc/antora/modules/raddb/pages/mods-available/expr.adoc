= Expr Module

The `expr` module has been removed, and replaced with an equivalent
`%{expr:...}` in the xref:reference:xlat/builtin.adoc[built-in
expansions].  The parameters to the `%{expr:...}` is an
xref:reference:unlang/expression.adoc[Unlang expression].

Most people should see no change in functionality.  However, the new
expressions offer significantly more operators, and work on more data
types.
