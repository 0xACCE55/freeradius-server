= The filter Statement

The `filter` statement is deprecated.  It may work, but it will be
removed in a future release.  The `filter` statement does not support
the data types of `group` and `struct`.

All new configuration should use the new xref:unlang/edit.adoc[edit]
syntax.  It is more flexible and more powerful than `filter` sections.
