= The catch Statement

.Syntax
[source,unlang]
----
try {
    ...
}
catch {
    [ statements ]
}
----

The `catch` statement runs a series of substatements in a block, but only if the previous xref:unlang/try.adoc[try] failed. 

[ statements ]:: The `unlang` commands which will be executed.  A
`catch` block can be empty.

.Example

[source,unlang]
----
try {
	sql
}
catch {
	# ... run only if sql failed
}
----

There is some overlap in functionality between `try` / xref:unlang/catch.adoc[catch] and xref:unlang/redundant.adoc[redundant].  The main difference (TODO) is that a xref:unlang/catch.adoc[catch] statement can catch specific actions.
