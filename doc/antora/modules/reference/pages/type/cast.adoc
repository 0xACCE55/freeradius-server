= Casts

Values can be *cast* from one data type to another.  However, this
cast only changes the _type_ of the data, it does not change the datas
_value_.  That is, a cast allows you to convert an `octets` data type
to a `string`, but the resulting `string` may still contain
non-printable characters.

Casting is used when the server is unable to automatically figure out
the correct data type to use.  For example, in the following
expansion, it is not immediately obvious that the right side of the
expression is an IP address.  It could instead be interpreted as a string
`"192.0.2.1"`.

[source,unlang]
----
if ("%{sql:SELECT ipaddress FROM table WHERE user=%{User-Name}}" == 192.0.2.1) }
    ....
}
----

Since there is no attribute reference on either side of the `==`
operator, the interpreter has no way of knowing that the string
`192.0.2.1` is an IP address.  There is unfortunately no way of
_always_ parsing strings in order to automatically determine which
data type to use.  Any such automatic parsing would work most of the
time, but it would have error cases where the parsing was incorrect.

The solution is to resolve these ambiguities by allowing the values to
be cast to a particular type.  Casting a value to a type tells the
interpreter how that value should be parsed.  Casting is done by
prefixing a value with the type name, surrounded by brackets;
`(...)`.

.Syntax
----
(...)value
----

We can add a cast to the above example, as follows:

.Example
[source,unlang]
----
if ("%{sql:SELECT ipaddress FROM table WHERE user=%{User-Name}}" == (ipaddr)192.0.2.1) }
    ....
}
----

In this example, we prefix the IP address with the string `(ipaddr)`.
The interpreter then knows that the value `192.0.2.` should be
interpreted as the data type `ipaddr`, and not as the literal string
`"192.0.2."`.

For a full list of data types which can be used in a cast, please see
the xref:type/all_types.adoc[list of data types] page, and the
"Basic Type Types" section.

In most cases, the server can automatically determine what data type
to use.  The cast syntax is used when either the data type is
ambiguous, or when data should be normalized prior to comparison, or
when a specific data type is required.

=== Expressions

Unlang xref:unlang/expression.adoc[expressions] can use casts, too, as
in the following example:

.Example Casting numbers to a 'string'
[source,unlang]
----
(string)(5 + 6)
----

The output of this cast will be the string value `"11"`.

Casting expressions can also be used to "force" specific data types.
For example, if we want to get the network byte-order value of a
16-bit integer, we can do the following:

.Example Casting numbers to a fixed-size network byte order
[source,unlang]
----
(octets)((uint16) 258)
----

The output of this cast will be an `octet` string having value
`0x0103`.  This kind of casting can be used to create and pack "ad
hoc" data structures for sending in a packet:

.Example Ad-hoc network structures
[source,unlang]
----
(octets)((uint16) 258) + (octets)((uint16) 4) + (octets)((ipv4addr) 127.0.0.1)
----

will result in the `octet` string value `0x010300047f000001`.

=== Compatibility

For compatibility with version 3, the `<cast>` syntax is also
supported.  We recommend, however, that people use the new syntax.
