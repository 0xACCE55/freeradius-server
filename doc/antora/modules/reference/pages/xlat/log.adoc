= Logging Functions

These functions perform logging at various levels.

We suggest using these messages only to log special or unusual events.
Producing multiple log messages per packet is not recommended, and can
have a surprisingly large (and negative) impact on performance.

== %log.debug(_string_)

Logs a message at a DEBUG level.  This function returns nothing.

[source,unlang]
----
%log.debug("Now processing %interpreter(...filename):%interpreter(...line)")
----

The DEBUG messages are printed only when the server has the debug flag set.

== %log.destination(_string_, [_uint32_])

The `%log.destination()` function updates the current request to add a new debug log destination.  The second argument sets the debug level (0..4).  If omitted, the default is `2`.  The special value `0` will remove the named log destination.

If the log destination is the empty string (`''`), then all extra debug log destinations are removed, and only the server default log destination will remain.

This function is normally used to _add_ a new log destination.  Any extra debug logging does not change the default log destination.  Normal server log messages will still go to the normal log destination, in addition to being sent to the newly added destination.

An existing log destination can be set multiple times.  The first time it is set, the log destination is added.  The second and subsequent times it is set, the log level is changed.  The server will not send duplicate messages to the same logging destination.

.Log Configuration in radiusd.conf
----
log tmp {
	destination = files
	filename = ...
}
----

.Set log destination in virtual server
[source,unlang]
----
%log.destination('foo')

== %log.err(_string_)

Logs a message at a ERROR level.  This function returns nothing.

[source,unlang]
----
%log.err("Something very bad happened")
----

The ERROR messages are always logged.

== %log.info(_string_)

Logs a message at a INFO level.  This function returns nothing.

[source,unlang]
----
%log.info("Doing something useful now")
----

The INFO messages are always logged.

== %log.warn(_string_)

Logs a message at a WARN level.  This function returns nothing.

[source,unlang]
----
%log.warn("Something bad might be happening")
----

The WARN messages are always logged.
