= Regular Expression Comparisons

.Example
[source,unlang]
----
(data =~ /regex/)
(data =~ /regex/i)

(data !~ /regex/)
(data !~ /regex/i)

The regular expression operators perform regular expression matching
on the data. The `data` field can be an attribute reference or data,
as with the other link:cond_cmp.adoc[comparison] operators.  The `/regex/`
field must be a valid regular expression.

The `=~` operator evaluates to `true` when `data` matches the
`/regex/` expression.  Otherwise, it evaluates to `false`.

The `!~` operator evaluates to `true` when `data` does not match the
`/regex/` expression.  Otherwise, it evaluates to `true`.

The regular expression comparison is performed on the _string
representation_ of the left side of the comparison.  That is, if the
left side is an link:../raddb/syntax/data_integer.adoc[integer], the regular
expression will behave is if the value `0` was the literal string
`"0"`.  Similarly, if the left side is an
link:cond_attr.adoc[&Attribute-Name], then the regular expression will
behave is if the attribute was printed to a string, and the match was
performed on the resulting string.

The syntax of the regular expression is defined by the regular
expression library used by the local system. These are usually
link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression.adoc#POSIX_basic_and_extended[Posix
regular expressions].

The regular expression may be followed by a single `i` character.  The
`i` indicates that the regular expression match should be done in a
case-insensitive fashion.

When the `=~` operator is used, then parentheses in the regular
expression will define variables that contain the matching text.

The special variable `%{0}` contains a copy of the result of
evaluating the data field.  The variables `%{1}` and following refer
to the subsequent matched substring in the regular expression.

Please see the link:xlat_predefined.adoc#_0[xlat documentation] for
more information on regular expression matching.
