		PAM Support for FreeRadius


0. INTRODUCTION

   PAM support was done by Jeph Blaize. Miguel a.l. Paraz <map@iphil.net>
   ported it to FreeRADIUS' parent, Cistron-Radius. Chris Dent <cdent@kiva.net>
   added the Pam-Auth attribute. It is not complete yet but seems to work
   (for authentication only).

1. USAGE

   Use Auth-Type = Pam in the users file.  You cannot use Password = "PAM"
   as in other radius servers. Sorry.

   You can also use ``Pam-Auth = "somestring"'' to specify an entry in
   /etc/pam.d. The default is "radius".

2. NOTES

   Use ./configure --with-pam to enable building of the PAM module
   (for now)

   Miguel has made PAM changes to the Cistron radiusd, since he now uses
   it as the basis of many accounting systems. However, according to the
   PAM experts, calling the pam_start function for each user to be
   authenticated is a bad idea. Seems to work for him, though.

   Besides, the Pam-Auth attribute only works if pam_start is called
   everytime anyways ..

3. TODO:

   Real PAM support, figure out how we can write a module that will make
   it blend in with PAM more seamlessly.  With this, we can replace the
   DENY_SHELL with something more flexible such as a database.

4. EXAMPLE:

DEFAULT Auth-Type = Pam,  NAS-IP-Address = 206.97.64.5
	Service-Type = Framed-User,
	Framed-Protocol = PPP,
	Framed-IP-Address = 255.255.255.254,
	Filter-Id = "std.ppp",
	Framed-MTU = 1500,
	Framed-Compression = Van-Jacobson-TCP-IP
DEFAULT Auth-Type = Pam,  Pam-Auth = "radius2", NAS-IP-Address = 127.0.0.1
	Service-Type = Framed-User,
	Framed-Protocol = PPP,
	Framed-IP-Address = 255.255.255.254,
	Filter-Id = "std.ppp",
	Framed-MTU = 1500,
	Framed-Compression = Van-Jacobson-TCP-IP
