Brief about how to build and test it!

1. The "eapol_test" should support the _Ctrl_ command 'GET_RADIUS_REPLY'. In this case, we must use the below repo/tag.

e.g:

```
$ export HOSTAPD_REPO="https://github.com/NetworkRADIUS/hostap" 
$ export HOSTAPD_GIT_TAG="feature/get_radius_reply"
$ ./scripts/ci/eapol_test-build.sh
```

2. Assuming the branch 'v4/pyfr' is properly merged in 'master' branch.

```
$ cd src/language/python
$ make clean install
```

3. The below test script should work!

```
$ ./tests/test.py
$ ./examples/radict.py User-Name
```
