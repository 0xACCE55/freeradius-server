About FreeTDS

 FreeTDS is an open source (or free software if you prefer) programming library,
 a re-implementation of the Tabular Data Stream protocol. It allows programs
 on many different operating systems to communicate with Sybase and 
 Microsoft SQL Servers.

The FreeTDS API is currently in development, so this module MAY NOT build.
If you want to use it, then you will have to edit the module source yourself,
and create the 'Makefile' yourself.
