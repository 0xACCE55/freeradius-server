### LDAP module INSTALL ###
This module depends on OpenLDAP v2.0 SDK libraries. As 2.0 branch is still considered unstable pre-release, you should obtain either current code snapshot or check out it sources from CVS. For details on obtaining source of OpenLDAP look at <http://www.openldap.org>. OpenLDAP SDK in turn depends on OpenSSL crypto libraries and Cyrus-SASL libraries.
