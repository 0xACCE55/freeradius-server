The files in this directory are "wrapper" files.  They do nothing more
than set a pragma, and include the system header file.

The purpose of these wrappers is to remove compile-time warnings.
They are NEVER installed.  Any file in the parent directory MUST NOT
include any "wrapper" file.  Only the C source files can include the
wrappers.
