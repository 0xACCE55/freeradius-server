See "update" and "default-input.txt" for examples.

In short, the test framework assumes Access-Request with PAP
authentication.  The password is hard-coded into the configuration,
and can't be changed.

The entire test suite consists of two files:

FOO contains a short piece of "unlang".  The shorter the better.  The
goal is to do something useful in unlang, and modify the input packet
and/or the reply.

FOO.txt contains the input packet and the filter for the reply.  There
always has to be attributes in the input, and filter attributes in the
reply.

If FOO.txt doesn't exist, then the "default-input.txt" file is used.
This allows many tests to be simplified, as all they need is a little
bit of "unlang".


The input packet is passed into the unit test framework, through the
FOO unlang snippet, and filtered through the reply filter.  If
everything matches, then the test case passes.
