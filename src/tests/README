#
#  Preliminary test harness.
#
#  1. Test packets go into a local file.
#  2. Simple configuration goes into the "users" file.
#      using attributes Test-Name && Test-Number, where appropriate
#  3. Realms go into "proxy.conf"
#  4. We use the default "radiusd.conf" file for some simple tests.
#
#  Type "make tests" for a series of tests that exercise (some)
#  of the server functionality.
#
#  See "runtests.sh" for more details.
