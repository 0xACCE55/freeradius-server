  If you have ANY problems, concerns, or surprises when running the
server, then run it in debugging mode, as root, from the command line:

$ radiusd -X

It will produce a large number of messages.  The answers to many
questions, and the solution to many problems, can usually be found in
these messages.

  For further details, see:

  and ./doc/bugs


For more general RADIUS information, the Livington internet site had a
lot of information on radius online.  Unfortunately Livingston, and
the site, don't exist anymore but there's a copy of the site still at:

Especially worth a read is the "RADIUS for Unix administrators guide"
