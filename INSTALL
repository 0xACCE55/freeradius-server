  Please read the README in the doc/ subdirectory. Section 2 gives you
complete details on how to configure, compile and install FreeRADIUS.

  If you do not need to modify the default configuration, then take
the following steps to build and install the server:


    ./configure
    make
    make install


  Configuring and running the server MAY be complicated.  Please read
the documentation in the doc/ directory for further information.
