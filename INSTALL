  Please read the README in the doc/ subdirectory. Section 2 gives you
complete details on how to configure, compile and install FreeRADIUS.

  If you do not need to modify the default configuration, then take
the following steps to build and install the server:


	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ make install

  Then, start the server in debugging mode:

	$ radiusd -X

  You should see a lot of text printed on the screen as it starts up.
If you don't, or if you see error messages, please read the FAQ:

	http://www.freeradius.org/faq/

  If the server says "Ready to process requests.", then it is running
properly.  From another shell (or another window), type:

	$ radtest test test localhost 0 testing123

  You should see the server print out more messages as it receives the
request, and responds to it.  The 'radtest' program should receive the
response within a few seconds.  It doesn't matter if the
authentication request is accepted or rejected, what matters is that
the server received the request, and responded to it.

  You can now edit the 'radiusd.conf' file for your local system.
Please read the ENTIRE file carefully, as many configuration options
are only documented in comments in the file.

  Configuring and running the server MAY be complicated.  Please read
the documentation in the doc/ directory for further information.  If
you have any issues, the FAQ is also a good place to check.
